    "#### Overview\n",
    "For this assignment, you will be using Python and Spark to perform some simple analyses on relational (tabular) data.  You will use Spark to read tabular data from files and then answer simple queries about the data in those tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to Python and Spark, you will need to use a little bit of SQL.  If you are already familiar with SQL, great.  If not, you will want to spend a short amount of time getting familiar with the basics.   Type \"SQL tutorial\" into your favorite search engine, and you will find many examples of text, interactive and video tutorials.   As a simple starting point, you might also want to look at [these slides](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~kmsalem/courses/cs743/F14/slides/sql.pdf), which give a short introduction to SQL.   Even this is much more than you will need for this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be working with tabular data based on the schema for the TPC-H benchmark, which is a standard test used to measure the performance of relational database systems.   The schema defines the tables that exist in the database, the information in each table, and relationships between information in one table and information in another.   The TPC-H schema models business information:  customers, orders, parts, suppliers, and so on.   You can find a diagram illustrating the TPC-H schema in the lecture notes.   You can also find it on page 13 of the [TPC-H benchmark specification](http://www.tpc.org/TPC_Documents_Current_Versions/pdf/tpc-h_v2.17.3.pdf).   The TPC-H schema is important for this assignment, so make sure that you keep this schema handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, for this assignment you will be using Spark in a slightly different way than you have used it so far.  For previous assignments, you have used the original Spark RDD interface.   For this assignment, you will be using the newer Spark interface, which is based on DataFrames.   DataFrames are RDDs in which each element is constrained to have the same structure.   You can think of a DataFrame like a table in a relational database.   Each element of the DataFrame is a row or record in the table.   All records have the same structure.   There is a programming guide for Spark DataFrames [here](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html).  Start with that. There is also a [more detailed guide to the full programming interface](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.sql.html).\n",
